Made this game to get a into Java, then expanded it with minimal sound effects and graphics for a school project.

#### Used sounds / graphics:

- [Apple](http://clipart-library.com/data_images/51443.png)
- [Background](https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/grass_template2.jpg)
- [Snake](https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/forum-attachments/snake_preview.png)
- Original Pac Man sounds (can't find the source I've got the sounds from)
